<!-- When websites ask you to verify “You’re not a robot” (like reCAPTCHA), they are using techniques to distinguish humans from automated bots. Here’s how it works:

1. Simple Checkbox reCAPTCHA (v2)
When you just tick a checkbox, it seems simple, but Google is analyzing multiple hidden factors:

Mouse movement & behavior:
Bots usually click perfectly, while humans move the mouse naturally with small shakes and pauses.

Click timing:
Humans take a random time to move and click; bots are instant.

Browser & device fingerprinting:
Your browser type, screen size, IP address, cookies, and other metadata help detect if you’re a normal user or a script.

If the system is confident you’re human → ✅ Passed without extra steps.
If suspicious → It will ask image challenges.

2. Image or Puzzle CAPTCHAs
If the checkbox alone is not enough:

You’re asked to select traffic lights, crosswalks, buses, or solve a puzzle.

This tests human visual recognition because bots struggle with complex images.

Google also uses your clicks to train AI for image recognition.

3. Invisible reCAPTCHA
Modern sites don’t even show a checkbox:

Monitors background user behavior, like:

Mouse or touch movements

Scrolling patterns

Typing speed

How you navigate the site

If it trusts you’re human → ✅ Automatically verified.

If suspicious → Shows a challenge.

4. Behind the Scenes
Risk Analysis Engine:
Google or similar services analyze your behavior, IP, and history to give a “risk score.”

Bot Detection Patterns:
Bots often:

Use headless browsers

Send requests too fast

Skip loading resources like CSS/images

Lack human interaction traces

5. Advanced Methods (reCAPTCHA v3)
Score-based system (0.0–1.0):

1.0 → Likely human

0.0 → Likely bot

No interaction needed unless the score is low → then a challenge appears. -->
